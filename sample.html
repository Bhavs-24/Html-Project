                    <p class="paragraph-description">Imagine an international gateway where goods and merchandise flow across borders. Where countries lower taxes, reduce red tape, and eliminate road blocks. Where companies import goods and merchandise directly into a Free Trade Zone - and then ship products out duty free.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph-description">The Miami Free Trade Zone connects North America, Europe and Asia to Latin America and the Caribbean via direct air and sea transportation links, plus rail and expressway. Operated by FTZ World Services, the 47-acre Zone (#372) saves companies money and time.</p>
